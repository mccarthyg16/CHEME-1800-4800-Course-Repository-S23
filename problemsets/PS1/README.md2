the only other people other than myself within that were used for help were Brandon and Jake. The only contributions we made 
together were that we could just copy and paste the code from lab 3d as most of the code is the exact same as what is being used

## ProblemSet
Within the problem set the command encrypt() encrypts a messages using a combination of letters to represent one letter in the 
actual sentence. The second part is the decrpyt function which takes an encrypted message and decrypts it using the same coded
message guide as the encryption command.
